\usage{
variant_ID(file, txdb = "MSK_RL", GT_cutoff = 35, VAF_cutoff = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{path to the h5 file}

\item{GT_cutoff}{Fraction of cells that are successfully genotyped for initial filtering (default 0.2, meaning 20\%)}

\item{VAF_cutoff}{Fraction of cells that are mutated for initial filtering of variants (default 0.005, meaning 0.05\%)}

\item{custom_txDB_object}{}
}
\value{
A dataframe with each variant on a row, and tally of the number of cells that are WT, Het, Hom or missing for a mutation. Calculated VAF and gentoyping freuqency is also provided. If multiple samples are present in the h5 file, a list object will be returned with each sample as an entry in the list
